# Moving MKAnnotationView.#

This sample iPhone project uses HGMovingAnnotation and HGMovingAnnotationView to show moving annotations on a map.

HGMovingAnnotation 
------------------

This class derives from MKAnnotation and adds the capability of updating the coordinate (position) and the rotation of the annotation. 
In the sample project, location updates are read from an <code>HGMapPath</code>, which is a collection of MKMapPoints stored on file. 

The current implementation of this class reads the next point on the path every second and updates the annotation's coordinate. 

HGMovingAnnotationView
----------------------

This class extends MKAnnotationView by animating its position and rotation on the map. It does this by observing its HGMovingAnnotation object. 

## iOS7 Compatible ##

- Updated deployment target of sample project to iOS6. HGMovingAnnotationView + HGMovingAnnotation can be used on pre-iOS6 versions as well.
